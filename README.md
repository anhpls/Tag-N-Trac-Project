# Tag-N-Trac Data Pipeline & Dashboard

This project is part of our ongoing development at **Tag-N-Trac**. We are building a full-stack system to collect, parse, store, and analyze real-time tracking data from IoT devices deployed in global supply chains. The system supports asset tracking, supply chain visibility, and real-time monitoring through a combination of cloud services, AI-powered data extraction, and optimized database workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- **IoT Data Ingestion:** Receive real-time data from tracking devices and sensors.
- **File Parsing & Extraction:** Process incoming files and extract structured data using AI-enhanced parsing.
- **n8n Automation:** Integrate n8n workflows for data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation before storage.
- **Supabase Integration:** Store, query, and manage structured data in a scalable Postgres database.
- **API-Driven Architecture:** Provide secure RESTful APIs to interface with frontend dashboards.
- **Smart Scheduling Optimization:** Dynamically prioritize and optimize data processing tasks.
- **Dashboard & Analytics:** Visualize device activity, supply chain routes, and historical trends.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Built for deployment on cloud providers for scalability and reliability.
