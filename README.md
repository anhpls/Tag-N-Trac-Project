# Tag-N-Trac Data Pipeline & Dashboard

This project is part of our ongoing development at **Tag-N-Trac**. We are building a full-stack system to collect, parse, store, and analyze real-time tracking data from IoT devices deployed in global supply chains. The system supports asset tracking, supply chain visibility, and real-time monitoring through a combination of cloud services, AI-powered data extraction, and optimized database workflows.
